# This file shows an example of a YML configuration for a GRAVITY dual-field on-axis OB
# in which 2 different positions are explored around HD206893 with the science fiber.

# The first section correspond to the general setup, used for all subsequence OBs in this file
# Please refer to the ESO Template manual for additional information

setup:
  run_id: 114.273V.002         # id of the run to upload the OB in the correct place
  date: 2025-02-15             # Required. But only useful if 'whereistheplanet' is used to predict position of the companion
  folder: filler-BD1-onax  # Folder in P2 where the OB will be uploaded.
  INS.SPEC.RES: "MED"         # spectral resolution. LOW, MED, or HIGH
  INS.SPEC.POL: "OUT"          # Polarisation. OUT or IN
  ISS.BASELINE: ["UTs"]        # baselines (small, large, or UTs)
  ISS.VLTITYPE: ["astrometry"] # snapshot, imaging, time-series, or astrometry
  SEQ.MET.MODE: FAINT          # the mode for the metrology laser. Can be FAINT, ON, or OFF
  concatenation: "none"   # if not empty, a concatenation with this name will be created and all OBs put in here
  constraints:                 # additional constraints
    skyTransparency: "Variable, thick cirrus"
    airmass: 1.6
    moonDistance: 10
    atm: 85%

# This section described the OBs, each made of a succession of template
# Multiple OBs can de defined in a file, but will share the same above setup.

ObservingBlocks:
  # Each OB is identified by a label which will also appear in P2

    description: on-axis on filler BD december # a short description of what this OB is

    target: HIP 21152                                # this target name will be resolved in simbad to populate various fields.

        name: BD companion

    # in dual-on, each element corresponds to one template, and can contain a concatenation of 1 single object from above, and sky

      # - s           # back on star
      # - c2 c2 sky   # 2 exposures on second position, and sky (will also be used for c1 which shares the same DITs params)
