# The first section correspond to the general setup, used for all subsequence OBs in this file
# Please refer to the ESO Template manual for additional information

  date: 2023-01-01             # Required. But only useful if 'whereistheplanet' is used to predict position of the companion
  folder: P112run   # Folder in P2 where the OB will be uploaded.
  INS.SPEC.RES: "MED"          # spectral resolution. LOW, MED, or HIGH
  INS.SPEC.POL: "OUT"          # Polarisation. OUT or IN

  ISS.VLTITYPE: ["astrometry"] # snapshot, imaging, time-series, or astrometry
  concatenation: 51Eri-and-calibrator    # if not empty, a concatenation with this name will be created and all OBs put in here

# This section described the OBs, each made of a succession of template
