# OB generation for 111.24MN.00X (51 Eri b monitoring campaign, PI: Balmer)
##########################################################################################

# The first section correspond to the general setup, used for all subsequence OBs in this file
# Please refer to the ESO Template manual for additional information

setup:
  run_id: 111.24MN.004         # id of the run to upload the OB in the correct place
  date: 2025-11-15            # Required. But only useful if 'whereistheplanet' is used to predict position of the companion
  folder: 51Erib-nov  # Folder in P2 where the OB will be uploaded.
  INS.SPEC.RES: "MED"          # spectral resolution. LOW, MED, or HIGH
  INS.SPEC.POL: "OUT"          # Polarisation. OUT or IN
  ISS.BASELINE: ["UTs"]        # baselines (small, large, or UTs)
  ISS.VLTITYPE: ["astrometry"] # snapshot, imaging, time-series, or astrometry
  SEQ.MET.MODE: ON          # the mode for the metrology laser. Can be FAINT, ON, or OFF  
  concatenation: "none" # if not empty, a concatenation with this name will be created and all OBs put in here
  constraints:                 # additional constraints
    skyTransparency: "Clear"
    airmass: 1.6
    moonDistance: 10
    atm: 30%


# This section described the OBs, each made of a succession of template
# Multiple OBs can de defined in a file, but will share the same above setup.

ObservingBlocks:
  # Each OB is identified by a label which will also appear in P2
  SCI_51Erib-nov1:
    # set FT mode manually so the concat is happy
    SEQ.FT.MODE: 1
    SEQ.MET.MODE: ON
    SEQ.PICKSC: F
    # in this first OB, we'll observe the planet using whereistheplanet to set the coordinates
    description: on-planet on-axis observations  # a short description of what this OB is
    mode: dual_on                               # can be dual_wide_on, dual_wide_off, dual_on, dual_off, single_on, or single_off
    target: 51Eri                                # this target name will be resolved in simbad to populate various fields.
    # objects is a list fiber pointings and exposure settings which will be used in the sequence
    objects:
      b:                       # arbitrary label of you choice. In this example, b is the planet
        name: 51Erib

      s:                       # arbitrary label of you choice. In this example, s is the star

        coord: [0, 0]          # coordinates relative to FT target in above system. Units are mas or deg. Or a name if whereistheplanet is used
    # in dual-on, each element corresponds to one template, and can contain a concatenation of 1 single object from above, and sky

      # - c1 c1       # 2 exposures on the first position
      # - s           # back on star
      # - c2 c2 sky   # 2 exposures on second position, and sky (will also be used for c1 which shares the same DITs params)
